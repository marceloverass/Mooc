# Java Programming from MOOC.fi

  I will go add all exercises from Java Programming l and Java Programming ll, courses from the [MOOC.fi (University of Helsink MOOC Center)](https://www.mooc.fi/en/) in this repository.

  All codes works, so if you have doubt about an exercise , you can consult and try it in your TMC Beans.
  
  I advise you not to abuse my codes, and only use them after having tried a lot to solve the exercises. And after using my codes, try to understand them, not     just copy and paste .
  
  This course is amazing, and you only will learning if you work hard and try on your own.
  
  Enjoy :)
